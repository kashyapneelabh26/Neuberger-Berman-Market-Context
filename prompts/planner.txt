Task: Turn KPIs into a structured outline the Writer must follow.

Input KPIs (source of truth):
{{ kpis_json }}

Rules:
- Do not add numbers; just reference which facts SHOULD appear.
- If a KPI is missing/null, mark the corresponding block "omit".
- Prioritize macro items with non-trivial moves (e.g., |Δbp| ≥ 5).

Return an ordered outline of 3–4 bullets:
- Benchmark return & shock(s)
- Macro (vol, rates, inflation, FX/commodities if provided)
- Sector leadership & laggards
- Earnings (if provided)

Avoid phrases: {{ banned_phrases }}
