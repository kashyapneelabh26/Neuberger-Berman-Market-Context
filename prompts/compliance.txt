Task: Enforce scope and numeric fidelity for the generated “Market Context”.

Inputs:
- Draft text:
{{ draft_text }}

- KPI dictionary (sole numeric source):
{{ kpis_json }}

Banned phrases (remove if present): {{ banned_phrases }}

Checks (apply in order):
1) Scope: remove any outlook, recommendations, portfolio attribution/positions/trades.
2) Numbers: replace any numeric mention that does not EXACTLY match the KPI dictionary; if uncertain, delete that sentence.
3) Coverage: ensure at least the benchmark return sentence appears. If missing, append one using KPI values.
4) Length: keep {{ word_target_min }}–{{ word_target_max }} words after edits.
5) Tone: professional, neutral, past tense; no causal claims unless explicitly in Planner notes.

Return ONLY the cleaned text.
